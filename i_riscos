RISCOS Installation Instructions
================================

Note: This game assumes sizeof(int) = sizeof(int *) = 4

(If you don't know what RISCOS is - see http://www.riscos.com )

Tested on the ACORN C/C++ compiler using the following:
C++ - V3.1, V3.13
C - V5.06, V5.09
Link - V5.06, V5.08

The GCC compiler may work, but it has not been tested

For Audio, ensure that the QTM module has been loaded.
See http://www.qthemusic.free-online.co.uk/

To Enable Cheat Mode: Modify the line containing "(CHEAT MODE DISABLED)" in source/riscos/doc.cpp

Basic Installation
==================

To extract the source code files into the standard directory structure:

Copy "source.riscos.extract" to "source.riscos.create"
Set "source.riscos.create" filetype to OBEY
Modify "source.riscos.create" to should your needs
Run "source.riscos.create"

If you have not modified the file, the following directory structure
will by created:

    adfs::4.$.!smb.!boot
    adfs::4.$.!smb.!run
    adfs::4.$.!smb.!sprites
    adfs::4.$.!smb.copying

    adfs::4.$.!smb.c++.xxxxxx
    adfs::4.$.!smb.h.xxxxxx
    adfs::4.$.!smb.o
    adfs::4.$.!smb.makefile
    adfs::4.$.!smb.makeold

If using C++ V3.1 : Drag "adfs::4.$.!smb.makeold" onto !AMU to create the game
If using C++ V3.13 : Drag "adfs::4.$.!smb.makefile" onto !AMU to create the game

You may need to modify "!run" if you do not have the QTM module

IMPORTANT
=========
If you want to distribute the game executable, these files should exist:
    adfs::4.$.!smb.!boot
    adfs::4.$.!smb.!run
    adfs::4.$.!smb.!sprites
    adfs::4.$.!smb.copying

    (The executable)
    adfs::4.$.!smb.!runimage

    + Any more files you wish to add

DO NOT distribute the source code in the extracted RISCOS format. Instead use the
original unmodified source code directory structure. Thank You :)

The End
