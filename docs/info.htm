<p align="center"><font size="5">FIRE POWER</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Puff and Blow each have a Methane
Gas Gun which fires a cloud of immobilising gas. If this comes
into contact with a bad guy he will be absorbed into the gas and
then float around the screen for a limited time. Bad guys are
harmless in this state. Puff and Blow must suck the floating gas
clouds into their guns and blast them out against a vertical
surface. Bad guys then turn into bonuses which can be collected.
Be warned! - the gas cloud dissolves with time after which
baddies become active again and extremely annoyed.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">POWER-UPS</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">There are dozens of power-ups
which may appear on any floor. They remain for only a few seconds
before disappearing. Here are some examples:-</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><img src="turbo.gif" width="62"
height="54"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">TURBO - Increases player speed</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><img src="potion.gif" width="52"
height="62"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">WHITE POTION - Invincibilty</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><img src="cookie.gif" width="58"
height="62"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">COOKIE - Smart Bomb</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">TIME LIMIT</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">After a set time limit on each
floor two Time Minions appear to destroy Puff and Blow. The Time
Minions chase them relentlessly around the screen and if they are
avoided for long enough another two will appear. Death is then
inevitable unless Puff and Blow manage to complete the level.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">GRUMP THE BLOCK</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><img src="block.gif" width="64"
height="48"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Grump is a bad-tempered block who
cannot move on his own. He is very useful to Puff and Blow who
can move him around by sucking him into their gas guns. They can
use him to stand on and also to form walls which they can fire
baddies at.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">SPRINGS</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><img src="spring.gif" width="64"
height="94"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">On some floors Puff and Blow will
come across sprites made of flexible steel which they can use to
catapult themselves into the air. These also have the advantage
of being moveable and can be used to make otherwise impossible
jumps.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">GENERATORS</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><img src="gen.gif" width="64"
height="98"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">A few floors within the game will
contain generators. These must be destroyed before a level can be
completed as they continually produce more and more bad guys.
There may be 1 or 2 on a floor and Puff and Blow must fire
baddies at them to destroy them.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">PLAYING CARDS</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">If Puff and Blow manage to
completely clear the screen before the &quot;<strong>HURRY UP</strong>&quot;
message appears on the screen, one playing card will appear (Ace
of Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds or Spades). If all four cards are
collected by either player that player will get and extra life.
Once a card is collected it is retained until the game is over.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">BADDIES</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Pudd and Blow must face many
different enemies with varying abilities including flying,
walking, jumping and shooting. Watch out for the Key Keeper and
his four different vehicles. Puff and Blow will need to use
different tactics to defeat these.</font></p>
