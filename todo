------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix these bugs:

(RISCOS) Sample rates incorrect
 ---> Code design problem. RISCOS requires an Amiga note. MIKMOD requires a frequency

(Win32) The "Flash White" when activating the switch in the treasure room does
        not operate when the game is in 32 colour mode (Amiga 500 emulation)

(Win32) The game options should be saved to the registry

I "Mark Page" <rombust@postmaster.co.uk> am no longer going to develop this game.
Instead I am only going to apply patches and fix serious bugs.

********************************
In January 2003, experimental 2 player mode was added.
However, this is incomplete and has been disabled.
To re-enable this feature, add:
#define EXPERIMENTAL_2_PLAYER_MODE 1
at the top of source/game.cpp

The following code parts still require modification
--> High Score table for player 1 and player 2
--> void CLinkObject::Fly2Player( CPlayerObj *play ) --> need to choose closest player
--> void CSuckable::SetExplode( void ) --> use ejected player for score
--> void CMBugWeapon::ControlAnim( void )
--> Bonus rooms in 2 player mode needs looking at in general
--> Targets require joystick for player 2 : ( jptr = &Game.m_GameTarget.m_Joy2; )
********************************

If you want to develop the game futher - Here are some ideas:

For the future:
Create a new target for Win32 running the CLANLIB library
Optional sound effect panning
A more developer friendly graphic and sound format

2 Player Mode (Simultaneously)
Real Joystick control.
Pause Mode (via 'P' being pressed) (like the amiga version - animated pause)
Pause codes. (Email rombust@postmaster.co.uk if you require the codes)
Level Number on the hiscore table
Cheat mode enabled via a key combination
SPR_POWER_HARDHAT (Jump on player 2 to reduce his height)
SPR_POWER_PINKFROG (Swap player 1 and player 2 for that level)
