Fix these:

(RISCOS) Sample rates incorrect
 ---> Code design problem. RISCOS requires an Amiga note. MIKMOD requires a frequency

(Win32) The "Flash White" when activating the switch in the treasure room does
        not operate when the game is in 32 colour mode (Amiga 500 emulation)

(Win32) The game options should be saved to the registry

(All) The "new" keyword has been replaced by SMB_NEW, which "should" return NULL on failure.
	However, the C++ standards, it throws an expection. A fix was put into place
	using the METHANE_OLD_CPP_NEW flag - However this is also broken.

Implement these:
(ALL)	SPR_POWER_HARDHAT (Jump on player 2 to reduce his height)
(ALL)	SPR_POWER_PINKFROG (Swap player 1 and player 2 for that level)
