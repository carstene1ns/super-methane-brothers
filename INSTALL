General Platform Installation Instructions
==========================================

For Platform Specific Installation instructions:
more i_linux   <---- Linux Install
more i_riscos  <---- RISCOS Install
more i_win32   <---- Windows Install (Using MFC)

Source Directory Notes
======================
Directory: "./" contains the readme files
Directory: "docs" contains the HTML documentaion page
Directory: "source" contains the main game files
Directory: "source/data" contains the data files (in .cpp)
Directory: "source/mikmod" contains the mikmod wrapper used by various targets
Directory: "source/win32" contains the windows platform files
Directory: "source/win32/mfc" contains the windows platform files using MFC
Directory: "source/linux" contains the linux platform files
Directory: "source/riscos" contains the RISCOS platform files

If you want to create your own platform target then
create a class called CMethDoc with doc.h as the header file.
The source file "source/target.cpp" is the only file that
refers to CMethDoc.

Note: This game assumes sizeof(int) = sizeof(int *) = 4

If using an old C++ compiler :
define METHANE_OLD_CPP  - To enable compatibility with non stdc compilers
define METHANE_OLD_CPP_NEW  - To enable compatibility with compilers that return 0 when the new keyword fails
