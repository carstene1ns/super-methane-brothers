Source Directory Notes
======================
Directory: "./" contains the readme files
Directory: "docs" contains the HTML documentaion page
Directory: "source" contains the main game files
Directory: "source/data" contains the data files (in .cpp)
Directory: "source/mikmod" contains the mikmod wrapper used by various targets

If you want to create your own platform target then
create a class called CMethDoc with doc.h as the header file.
The source file "source/target.cpp" is the only file that
refers to CMethDoc.

Note: This game assumes sizeof(int) = sizeof(int *) = 4
